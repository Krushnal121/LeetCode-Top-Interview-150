# LeetCode-Top-Interview-150

Welcome to the **LeetCode-Top-Interview-150** repository! This project documents my journey of solving one programming problem from LeetCode every day for the next 150 days. Let's code and conquer together! 💻💪

## 🌟 Introduction

This repository is all about sharpening my problem-solving skills by tackling one programming problem from LeetCode each day. Starting from `28/08/2024`, I’ll be pushing my limits for 150 consecutive days. Each solution will be recorded here, along with the problem statement and a breakdown of my approach. Let's get coding! 🚀

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
.
├── README.md
├── Day_1
│   ├── problem.md
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── solution.java
├── Day_2
│   ├── problem.md
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── solution.java
...
├── Day_150
    ├── problem.md
    ├── solution.py
    └── solution.java
```

- Each day's folder contains:
    - `problem.md`: 📜 The problem statement from LeetCode.
    - `solution`: 💾 My solution in Java and Python.

## 📈 Progress

| Day | Problem Title                                                                                  | Solution Link                                   |

## 🚀 Getting Started

To dive into the solutions, navigate to the corresponding day's folder and open the `solution.py` or `solution.java`. Check out the `notes.md` file for insights into my approach and logic.
